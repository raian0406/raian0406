[{"content":"Academic Status I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the CERMICS lab, and am a part of the MATHERIALS INRIA research project. My PhD project revolves around the analysis of algorithms designed to accelerate the sampling of rare events, such as the transitions between metastable configurational states in molecular systems typically encountered in biology or condensed matter physics. This PhD is funded by the EMC2 ERC Synergy grant, and my advisors are Tony Lelievre and Gabriel Stoltz.\nResume Previously, I completed a MSc / M2 in Stochastic Processes, at Sorbonne Université in Paris. My thesis, Probabilités non-commutatives et entropie libre, can be found here (in French).\nI then completed a MSc / M2 in Numerical analysis and PDEs, also at Sorbonne Université. My research internship, (Non)-equilibrium molecular dynamics and a Norton method for the estimation of transport coefficients, took place at CERMICS with Gabriel Stoltz, and the resulting report can be found here.\nA PDF version of my resume can be found here.\nBroader Interests I am scientifically interested in the field of computational statistical physics and the interface between probability and PDE analysis. For numerical applications, I enjoy working with the Julia programming language, but I am also proficient in C/C++ and Python.\n","permalink":"https://raian0406.github.io/about/","summary":"Academic Status I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the CERMICS lab, and am a part of the MATHERIALS INRIA research project.
